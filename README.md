# CodeBlocksGlut
CodeBlocks with Freeglut library linked.
# Why is this necessary?
Linking the freeglut library is tedious. If you just need the ffreeglut library for your project, it will be less painful to replace you compiler and codeblocks folders with these folders in the repo. 
# Additional Information
You also need to put the freeglut.dll file into your windows directory for glut to work.
